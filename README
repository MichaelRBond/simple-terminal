st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

Notes about this fork
---------------------

This is a fork of ST, the original repo can be found here: https://git.suckless.org/st/

The original ST webpage is here: https://st.suckless.org/

This fork has the following changes from version 0.8.1

Patches applied:

* Box Draw : Improves box drawing for NCurses applications : https://st.suckless.org/patches/boxdraw/
* Hide Cursor : Hides the mouse cursor when typing in the terminal : https://st.suckless.org/patches/hidecursor/
* Vert Center : Centers text on a line when line scale is modified : https://st.suckless.org/patches/vertcenter/

Back Port changed:

Additionally I've back ported several up-stream fixes for memory leaks and crashes that were not in the 0.8.1 release.
This was done because the patches I wanted to apply were not compatible with the newer commits, and it was less work to
backport the changes on the patched code than update the patches.

Personal Customizations:

* Modify the standard terminal blue color to be lighter, and more readbale
* Update the pixel size to be more readbale on HiDPI screens

Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

necessary as root):

----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
